# vantage-de
This is my first try to translate the Vantage theme for Wordpress into German language. I needed this for a project and thought this might be useful for others, too.

**Please beware: So far, I translated only parts of the original language file – this is work in progress.**

## Installation

Simply clone or download the de_DE.po und de_DE.mo files and put them in the following folder in your WordPress installation:
``/wp-content/themes/vantage/languages/``

That should be pretty much it.
